# Schnorr identification protocol over Curve25519
Implementation of the Schnorr identification protocol over Curve25519 by using Ristretto.

## Disclaimer
This library is not meant for production use, it's more like a personal experiment.

## Implementation
The basic algorithms used are taken from chapter 19 of the book [Applied Cryptography](https://toc.cryptobook.us/), and then adapted to be used with Curve25519.
